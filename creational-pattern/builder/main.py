        Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
        retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may create
        entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.
        Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface
        (at least in a statically typed programming language).

        Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
        That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of
        the `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory,
        and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
        client code before disposing of the previous result.
